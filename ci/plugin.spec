%description
This plugin tracks face of a person by detecting and tracking a face.

This plugin employs dlib on face detection and object tracking. The frame of
the source is periodically taken to face detection algorithm. Once a face is
found, the face is tracked. Based on the location and the size of the face
under tracking, the frame will be cropped.
